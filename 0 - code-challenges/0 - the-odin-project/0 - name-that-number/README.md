# Name That Number

[More info.](https://forum.theodinproject.com/t/name-that-number/986)

> You may be familiar with American adverts on television where they convert their telephone numbers into words and add a jingle to them so they can annoyingly sing them to you in a cheesy tune. The challenge is to create a program that can take a phone number such as 0800-TOP-ODIN and convert it to the telephone number equivalent 0800-807-6346.
>
> Example inputs and outputs
>
> Input: "0100-AWE-SOME"
> Output: “0100-293-7663”
>
> Input: "0946-LUV-CODE"
> Output: “0946-588-2633”
>
> Optional Extensions:
> Can you extend your program so that only words in the dictionary are allowed?
>
> For the extension you can throw an error or return a nil/null value for a word that isn’t in the dictionary
>
> Example inputs and outputs
>
> Input: "0345-DOG-TAIL"
> Output: “0345-364-8245” - because both ‘dog’ and ‘tail’ are both words you > would find in the dictionary
>
> Input "0230-XYZ-GTOE"
> Output: Error or Nil/Null - as ‘xyz’ and ‘gtoe’ would not be found in a dictionary
